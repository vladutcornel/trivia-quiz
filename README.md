# Cornel's Trivia React App

This a Vue.js-guy's (poor) attempt to learn React for a job interview.

## Q&A
**Why haven't you done/used X?**  
If it's some React feature, or industry-standard module, it's possibly I haven't had a chance to learn about it or understand it's utility.

**Why double quotes?**  
I learned programming with classic C, then C++ and Java. Strings were always defined with "double-quotes".  
The fact that JavaScript standards all require strings to be defined with 'single-quotes' is mind-boggling.  
It's more annoying that there is no good explanation on why that is.  
I know most projects 'single quotes' because they want to fully adhere to a particular coding standard, and I can reluctantly adapt to it. This is my project, and I would rather use my own style.
